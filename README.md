[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b654c94e-08a6-4b79-b443-7837581b1d8d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms-ci/deploys)

**Note:** This repository uses [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/).

- Uses `gatsby-image` with Netlify-CMS preview support
- Netlify deploy configuration
- Almost Perfect score on Lighthouse for SEO, Accessibility and Performance

## Prerequisites

- Node
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)
- [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli)

### Access Locally

```
$ yarn
$ netlify dev # or ntl dev
```

This uses the new [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifycms&utm_campaign=devex) CLI feature to serve any functions you have in the `lambda` folder.

To test the CMS locally, you'll need to run a production build of the site:

```
$ npm run build
$ netlify dev # or ntl dev
```

## Purgecss

This plugin uses [gatsby-plugin-purgecss](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-purgecss/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io/). The bulma builds are usually ~170K but reduced 90% by purgecss.
